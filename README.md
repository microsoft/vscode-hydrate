# Hydrate Extension for Visual Studio Code
[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/epicstuff/vscode-hydrate/_apis/build/status/microsoft.vscode-hydrate?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/epicstuff/vscode-hydrate/_build/latest?definitionId=104&branchName=master)
## Overview
This is the Visual Studio Code Hydrate extension, which builds upon the [VSCode Kubernetes Extension](https://github.com/Azure/vscode-kubernetes-tools). It allows developers to use [Hydrate](https://github.com/microsoft/hydrate) within VSCode, which crawls a Kubernetes cluster and generates a high level description in a `component.yaml` file for its deployments.

Instead of running Hydrate from the command line and entering flags and options manually, this extension will allow users to select a Kubernetes cluster and input options in VSCode.
 
## Test Out the Extension!
First, make sure that you have the [VSCode Kubernetes Extension](https://github.com/Azure/vscode-kubernetes-tools) installed on VSCode and that you have cloned [Hydrate](https://github.com/microsoft/hydrate) into your home directory (currently, the extension uses the home directory as the default path to the Hydrate clone).

Next, clone this repo, and open it in VSCode by running `code ./vscode-hydrate` from its parent directory. Once the window opens, press `F5` to open the Extension Development Host. 

A new window will open running the VSCode Hydrate extension. Click the Kubernetes extension icon in the sidebar, then right-click the cluster you would like to Hydrate and click `Hydrate Cluster`. The Hydrate output can be seen in the Debug Console in the original window, and a `component.yaml` file will be generated in your home directory!

Note: all clusters displayed in the sidebar are associated with the same `kubeconfig` file. To test out a different kubeconfig, click the "options" icon (the three dots) in the Kubernetes extension cluster explorer and click `Set Kubeconfig` to change the current `kubeconfig` file used. Then, you can run Hydrate on the newly displayed clusters with the new kubeconfig. 


## Dependencies
* [VSCode Kubernetes Tools and its dependencies](https://github.com/Azure/vscode-kubernetes-tools)
