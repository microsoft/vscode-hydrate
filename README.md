# Hydrate Extension for Visual Studio Code
[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/epicstuff/vscode-hydrate/_apis/build/status/microsoft.vscode-hydrate?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/epicstuff/vscode-hydrate/_build/latest?definitionId=104&branchName=master)
## Overview
This is the Visual Studio Code Hydrate extension, which builds upon the [VSCode Kubernetes Extension](https://github.com/Azure/vscode-kubernetes-tools). It allows developers to use [Hydrate](https://github.com/microsoft/hydrate) within VSCode, which crawls a Kubernetes cluster and generates a high level description in a `component.yaml` file for its deployments.

Instead of running Hydrate from the command line and entering flags and options manually, this extension allows users to select a Kubernetes cluster and run Hydrate within VSCode.
 
## Install the Extension!
First, make sure that you have cloned [Hydrate](https://github.com/microsoft/hydrate) into your home directory (currently, the extension uses the home directory as the default path to the Hydrate clone).

Next, download the extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=madelineliao.vscode-hydrate). If you do not have the [VSCode Kubernetes Extension](https://github.com/Azure/vscode-kubernetes-tools) installed, it will automatically be installed during the Hydrate extension installation. A window reload is required after installation.

Navigate to the Kubernetes view by clicking the Kubernetes icon in the sidebar. Right-click the cluster you would like to run Hydrate on, and select `Hydrate Cluster`. A `component.yaml` file for the corresponding kubeconfig file will be generated in your home directory!

Note: all clusters displayed in the sidebar are associated with the same `kubeconfig` file. To test out a different kubeconfig, click the "options" icon (the three dots) in the Kubernetes extension cluster explorer and click `Set Kubeconfig` to change the current `kubeconfig` file used. Then, you can run Hydrate on the newly displayed clusters with the new kubeconfig. 

## Testing the Extension
First, clone the repo locally by running the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-hydrate
```

There are two ways to run tests:
1. From the command line, within the `vscode-hydrate` directory, run:
```
npm test
```
2. Alternatively, tests can be run in VSCode. From wherever the cloned repo lives, run:
```
code ./vscode-hydrate
```
Then, navigate to the Debugger view in the sidebar. Click the dropdown next to the green 'play' button, and click `Extension Tests`. Then click the play button to run the tests. Output will be printed to the VSCode `Debug Console`.
