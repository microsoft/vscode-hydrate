# Hydrate Extension for Visual Studio Code

## Overview
This is the Visual Studio Code Hydrate extension, which builds upon the [VSCode Kubernetes Extension](https://github.com/Azure/vscode-kubernetes-tools). It allows developers to use [Hydrate](https://github.com/microsoft/hydrate) within VSCode, which crawls a Kubernetes cluster and generates a high level description in a `component.yaml` file for its deployments.

Instead of running Hydrate from the command line and entering flags and options manually, this extension will allow users to select a Kubernetes cluster and input options in VSCode.
 

## Dependencies
* [VSCode Kubernetes Tools and its dependencies](https://github.com/Azure/vscode-kubernetes-tools)
* [Hydrate](https://github.com/microsoft/hydrate) and its dependencies
